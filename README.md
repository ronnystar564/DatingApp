Step 1: Setting Up the Project
First, we started by creating a place to store all the information for our project, kind of like setting up a new filing system. We did this using a tool called SQL Server. Then, we created the basic structure of our application using a framework called ASP.NET Core. This is like laying the foundation for a building. We also made sure this new application could talk to our SQL Server to store and retrieve data.

Step 2: Creating the API
Next, we built a set of instructions that allow other programs to interact with our application. Think of these instructions as a mail system, where you can send and receive information. We created two main instructions: one to add new information (like signing up for a new account) and one to get information (like checking the list of users). We tested these instructions using a tool called Postman, ensuring that our "mail system" worked perfectly.

Step 3: Storing Data
We then used Postman to send some test information to our application, like adding a new user with an ID and a username. We checked to make sure this information was stored correctly in our "filing system" (the SQL Server database). This step was all about making sure our application could save and find the data it needed.

Step 4: Setting Up the Frontend
Moving on to the part of the project that users actually see and interact with, we downloaded a tool called Node.js and used another tool called Angular to create the visual part of our application. It's like designing the front of a shop where customers will come in. We built different components to display the information stored in our database.

Step 6: Developing User Accounts
We created a way for users to sign up and log in. For signing up, users need to provide a username and a password. We made sure that each username is unique and that passwords are securely encrypted (kind of like locking them in a safe). For logging in, users enter their username and password, and the system checks if they match what's in the safe. If they do, the user gets a special key (a token) that allows them to access the system securely. We tested this whole process to make sure it worked properly.

 Step 7: Enhancing the Frontend with Bootstrap
To make our application look nice and be easy to use on any device, we used a design toolkit called Bootstrap. This helped us create a navigation bar (like a menu in a restaurant) and design a responsive login page that looks good on phones, tablets, and computers. We also created a registration page for new users to sign up and a home page. We made sure the registration page was linked to the home page and that data could be passed between them smoothly. We used some special features of Angular to make the code efficient and easy to manage.

Social Dating App
All these steps were for building a social dating app. The app allows users to sign up, create profiles, and find other users. The secure login and registration system keeps user data safe. The user-friendly interface and responsive design ensure that the app looks good and works well on all devices. Users can navigate through different pages, register, log in, and browse profiles easily.# DatingApp
